## Terrones_POS system
I am currently developing a web-based system that allows for the management of products from any device with a web browser. Unlike other Point of Sale (POS) systems, mine uniquely allows for the rapid adjustment of prices and profit percentages by grouping profits by product lines. It supports multi-warehouse functionality and manages accounts receivable and payable. I am in the process of migrating this system to React.
